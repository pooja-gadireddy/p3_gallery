One second of hesitation, and I’m back to the beginning of the song. Playing the piano has kept me in rhythm - all the notes and timings have to be perfect, but even if it isn’t, there’s always a way to fix it. I have always been interested in music, mainly listening to the trendy pop songs that played on station 96.1 on car rides. I thought to myself if I love listening to music, why can’t I create it? My stress-relieving, yet also stress-inducing journey with the piano began when I was in sixth grade. I started off with the classics, like the Happy Birthday song, When the Saints go Marching, and Hot Cross Buns, but I later progressed into complicated Russian ballads and folk music, some slow and some fast to the point where my fingers moved like Speedy Gonzales from Looney Tunes. Though I have only had the honor of performing at a limited number of recitals, I’m glad to know that my ten fingers and two feet can create music for people to dance or sing to. </p>

	  <h1>Art</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/art.jpg" alt="close up of mixed paint color splash" width="250" height="166" class="floatleft"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">While I've never</span> considered myself an art scholar, or really anything more than an amateur, over the years, as I have dabbled with different art forms and styles, I have come to appreciate the historic styles present and the influences behind the actual piece of artwork. I have always been a creative person and loved fiddling with anything that fits in my hands. This led me to join my first art class in elementary school. At this point, I was mainly working on color theory, straight lines, the basic concepts, which were a bit plain, but those few concepts apply to every single art piece; mastering these fundamentals allowed me to become a better artist and visionary. As I practiced my fundamentals, I started exploring mediums other than colored pencils, such as watercolor, acrylic, oil paint, pastels, and even graphic design. From the Information Technology Academy at my school, I was given the opportunity to fine-tune my skills through Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign certifications. I know it is not in the cards for me to be the next Picasso, but I am still so grateful for all the ways art has enriched my life, whether it be through sheer enjoyment of a stunning piece or giving me the skills and knowledge to excel in the field of graphic design.</p>

	  <h1>Science Olympiad</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/science.jpg" width="250" height="166" alt="lightened dna strand picture in blue"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">Butterflies roaring</span> in my stomach as I frantically check my watch to make sure I get to my event on time; Science Olympiad has been a journey for me since sixth grade. I still remember the stress that went through my head as I was picking an event from their plethora of different hands-on and knowledge-based events. After some searching, I decided to go with Forensics, Food Science, and Bridge Building for my first set of Science Olympiad events. My partner and I spent so much time working on our events, only to see our bridge break within seconds of the judge pouring sand on it, soon foreshadowing the downfall of all of our events. It wasn’t a winning year for us, but what we learned from the competition about anatomy, chemical compounds of everyday materials, and the scientific method was more valuable than any medal. Since my first competition, feeling disappointed while simultaneously proud of what I learned, my curiosity, lust for knowledge, and skill have grown immensely. Because of this growth, I was able to secure wins in Chemistry lab, 3rd in fast facts, and 5th in disease detectives, but even if I had never placed in any event of all the seven years I competed, Science Olympiad would still occupy a very special place in my heart. </p>
